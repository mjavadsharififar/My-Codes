# My-Codes
Hello and welcome to my 1st reposetory, here you can see my codes on machine learning that somehow represent my resomes in this filed. some points about these files should be mentioned:
1. All these codes are answers to challenges designed by different data science websites. The description and links of the main challenge pages are in the preamble of each file
2. I have some other codes _ such as statistical analysis, learning pandas, numpy and matplotlib , learning classification and clustering _ which have not been uploaded here, becuase I thought those are much informal and usuall to upload them here. If you are interested in accessing those, pls let me know.

I hope these codes satisfy your expecations.\
Best regards, mjavad sharififar
